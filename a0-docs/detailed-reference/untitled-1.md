# Processor

A0 has two PCBs; one contains the ESP32 processor module, while the other contains the OBD2 connector and interface electronics. The upper PCB has a single momentary pushbutton \(requires removing the case to access\) and a single green status LED clearly visible through the top of the smoked case. A0 can communicate via WiFi and Bluetooth, or using the built-in microUSB port.

A0 uses the very popular Espressif ESP32, both as the application processor and the WiFi/BT radio processor.
