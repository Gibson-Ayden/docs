# Power

Like all electronics, your A0 requires power to run. Your A0 can be connected directly to an OBD2 port for power. In addition, A0 can be powered via USB. If both USB power and OBD2 power are present, OBD2 power is prioritized. 

## Protection <a id="protection"></a>

A0 employs several circuits to protect the device from overcurrent, reverse voltage, and overvoltage.
