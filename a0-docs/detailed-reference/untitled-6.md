# Pin Mapping

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note: this section to be updated with A0 specific pin mapping. 
{% endhint %}

**Use the names in the "Mapped Pin Name" column in your Arduino Sketch.**

A "pin mapping" describes how the different circuits of your M2 are connected to the processor. For example, the Green LED \(DS6 on the schematic\) is connected to pin 7 \(AKA PA14\) of the processor. To make things easier from a programming standpoint, we can map this to a pin name, in this case, the green LED is mapped to the name `DS6` \(which is compiled to the value 18\).
