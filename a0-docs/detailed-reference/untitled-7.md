## ADD SOMETHING ABOUT WIFI & BT?  <a id="usb"></a>

## USB <a id="usb"></a>

A0 has a USB connector that can act as either a HOST or DEVICE depending on your code. 

A0 uses Native USB port only. To print something to the Serial monitor, you'd need to use this command:

```text
SerialUSB.print("Something");
```

## IS ANY OF THAT TRUE OF A0?
